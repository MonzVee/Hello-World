A train service calculates your travelling cost based on the distance you travel. You will also
receive a discount if you decide to take a return trip rather than a one-way trip.
● Create a file train.html, and create a form that allows the user enter :
○ the distance the user is travelling.
○ whether the trip is a return or one-way (using a drop-down list)
● Also make sure you have a submit button that the user can press after inputting their
information.
● Create another file named train.php, that will perform the calculations.
● This program must display the total travelling cost.
● The travelling cost is calculated according to the following guidelines:
○ If the distance is less than or equal to 70 km the total cost must equal the
distance multiplied by R1.50 .
○ If the distance is less than 90 km and greater than 70 km the total cost must
equal the distance multiplied by R1.00 .
○ If the distance equals 90 km or greater the total cost must equal the distance
multiply by R0.75 .
○ If the trip is a return trip the user must get 10% off.
● The program must then display to the user the total cost of the trip, as well as the total
distance and whether the trip is a return or one-way trip
